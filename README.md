* [PJRC Encoder Library for Teensy and Arduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_Encoder.html)

**One of the examples, MotorPositionControlInterrupt, uses the FlexiTimer2 library to periodically call the motor update function:**
* [FlexiTimer2 library](https://github.com/wimleers/flexitimer2)

**If you want to use motors with your Bricktronics Shield or Megashield, you may also be interested in these libraries:**
